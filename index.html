                1 Sift the flour, add salt, sugar, yeast and baking powder to
                it, mix them, pour warm water gradually and knead until it
                becomes a firm dough. 2 Knead for about ten minutes, then grease
                the dough with oil, place it in an oiled bowl, cover and leave
                it for an hour to rest in a warm place. 3 After that, roll out
                the dough with the dough in the shape of a circle and pierce it
                with a fork so that it does not rise. 4 Place the crab sticks on
                the edges and then seal the edges of the dough. 5 With a knife,
                cut the closed ends with a distance of 3 cm between each piece,
                then turn it over to reveal the crab fingers as shown in the
                picture. 6 We put in the centre of the dough from the oyster
                sauce or pizza sauce as available 7 Drain the tuna from the oil,
                sprinkle it with a pinch of salt and black pepper and spread it
                in the centre of the dough, then spread it with sliced peppers,
                tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. 8 Enter a hot oven at a
                temperature of 200 degrees for a quarter of an hour and serve
                here.

                1 Take a cup of flour, yeast, sugar, tomatoes and water in a
                kneading dish and stir (it will look like flour) and leave it
                for 10 minutes to 15 minutes 2 After it has fermented, add the
                rest of the flour and oil and knead until it becomes a soft
                dough (then divide it in half and let it rest for 10 minutes) 3
                In the meantime, put the sauce and spices on the fire and add a
                little water, not too much, to keep it thick once it boils, turn
                off the heat. 4 Spread each portion on a lightly floured surface
                and then place them in a tray greased with very light oil. 5 Put
                a spoonful of sauce on each tray and spread it well, then a
                sprinkle of cheese, then tuna, then crab, then tomatoes, then
